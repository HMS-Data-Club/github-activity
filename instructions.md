# Instructions

This will walk you through the steps we're going to explore for today's Github activity. 
  
## Part 1: Adding a restaurant review

1. Get a local copy of the github-activity repository
 
    - Remember that in order to have a local copy, you have to both `clone` _and_ `pull/fetch`.  

2. Add a review of a restaurant in the Longwood area by creating a new .md file in the `restaurants` folder. 
  
    - Follow the same format as the example Squealing Pig review. 
  
    - Make sure to also link the file from `index.md` so we can find the review.
  
3. Commit and push your changes. 
  
    - Use a meaningful commit message. 
  
## Part 2: Adding an animal review
  
Now follow a similar series of steps to add a review of an animal to the `animal_reviews.md` file. 

Tips:

- You shouldn't have to clone the repository again, since it should already be on your computer. Is there another step you have to do again?
- Add a review to the the table by copying the syntax of the row above it. 
- Remember to commit and push your changes.
  
## Part 3: Undoing 
    
__Oh no!__ Our boss just yelled at us. We were only supposed to add new animal reviews by pull request. 

Remove your animal review. 
  
## Part 4: Making a branch and pull request
    
1. Make a branch and add your animal review there. 
2. Create a pull request to merge your changes back in. 
3. Review and approve at least 1 other member's pull request.
